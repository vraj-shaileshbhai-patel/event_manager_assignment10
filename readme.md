## Learning from this assignment

This assignment was a great learning, not only in technical skills but also in teamwork. The user lifecycle, identification of bugs, and improvement of functions with a QA-focused approach went deep into my understanding of the codebase. Working with Docker Compose taught me how microservices communicate and how to troubleshoot connectivity using tools like pgAdmin. Writing test cases and improving code coverage underlined the importance of robust testing during development.

It was quite a challenge to balance immediate fixes with long-term design goals, but it was very rewarding. The reutilization of functions and systematic solving of problems increased my confidence in handling complex codebases. This experience pinpointed clear communication between the QA and development teams and cemented the importance of structured and detailed-oriented approaches toward the creation of reliable applications.
